## Published papers

- _Inequality, Leverage and Crises_, Michael Kumhof and Romain Rancière. Forthcoming in 2015, American Economic Review. ([paper](files/papers/inequalities.pdf))

        The paper studies how high household leverage and crises can be caused by changes in the income distribution. Empirically, the periods 1920-1929 and 1983-2008 both exhibited a large increase in the income share of high-income households, a large increase in debt leverage of low- and middle-income households, and an eventual financial and real crisis. The paper presents a theoretical model where higher leverage and crises are the endogenous result of a growing income share of high-income households. The model matches the profiles of the income distribution, the debt-to-income ratio and crisis risk for the three decades preceding the Great Recession.

- _The Risky Steady-State_, with Helene Rey and Nicolas Coeurdacier, American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 2011. ([paper](files/papers/the_risky_steady_state_1.pdf))

        We propose a simple quantitative method to linearize around the risky steady state of a small open economy. Unlike when the deterministic steady state is used, the net foreign asset position is well defined. We allow for both stochastic income and stochastic interest rate.

- _A LARCH(∞) Vector Valued Process_, with Paul Doukhan and Gilles Teyssière, Lecture Notes in Statistics, 187, Springer, New York, 2006.
([paper](files/papers/dwt1.pdf))

        We introduce a vector version of the ARCH(∞) equation yielding a simple approach to various models like bilinear or GARCH models. To this aim we provide an explicit chaotic expansion of a solution for this ARCH(∞) equation, and show the uniqueness of this solution under reasonable conditions. Independent or N-Markov approximations of this process allow to simulate a trajectory or to derive bounds for their weak dependence coeﬃcients as deﬁned by Doukhan and Louhichi (1999). We ﬁnally consider a long range dependent version of this model; in this case we provide an existence and uniqueness result
